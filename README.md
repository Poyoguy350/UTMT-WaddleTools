# Undertale Modding Tool: WaddleTools
Tools in .csx script made for my convenience. (hopefully for yours too!)

**NOTE:** These tools are made for my Pizza Tower modding endeavors and are *not that perfect* and could be buggy because i don't do C# that much *(even though this took like a million of revisions)*, that's why i put it on a repo! If you know you can help improve these, it would mean a lot! :)

## Scripts and their functionalities:
### SpriteEditorStandalone.csx:
Script that let's you edit sprites in an editor!

(***PROTIP:*** Being in a sprite tab automatically launches the editor without prompting you to type a sprite name!)

### ImportGraphicsSharp.csx (WORK IN PROGRESS! NOT INCLUDED IN ANY RELEASES!!):
An advanced graphics importer script! (Will be in tandem with the WaddleTools Sprite Editor!)

### ReduceTextures.csx (WORK IN PROGRESS! NOT INCLUDED IN ANY RELEASES!!):
Script meant to clean off unreferenced Embedded Textures or Page Items! (Unused sprites was originally planned here but code referencing sprite as numbers bug things so grrrr that's why its put on hold for now unless I decided I'll not include a Unused Sprites Cleanup feature in it's release or someone else smarter than me figure it out...)

3. Have fun toying with the tools!
